# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax


# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born
hometown <- "Shanghai"
# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`
my.name <- "Joyce"
# Assign your height to a variable `my.height`
my.height <- 170
# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have
puppies <- 27
# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is
puppy.price <- 300
# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies
total.cost <- puppies * puppy.price
# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to true if the cost is greater than $1,000
too.expensive <- total.cost > 1000
# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the nuber of puppies you can afford for $1K.
max.puppies <- floor(1000 / puppy.price)
